## 1\. The record *(3 marks)*

*What one manuscript looks like in our system, and what we do when a field is unknown.*

| Field | Type | Example | If it is unknown, we… |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id |  | `MS001` |  |
| title |  |  |  |
| city |  |  |  |
| year |  |  |  |
| condition |  |  |  |

---

## 2\. Our validation rules *(4 marks)*

| Field | Rule(s) | Rejects (example) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id |  |  |
| title |  |  |
| city |  |  |
| year |  |  |
| condition |  |  |

### Who decided the year range?

*The brief gave you 1100–1900. That was a decision someone made, and it has costs. 1900 excludes a modern copy of an old text. 1100 excludes anything earlier. State whether you accept these bounds or would change them, and say what your choice throws away. An undefended range scores 1 of the 4 marks.*

## 3\. The `c.1590` decision *(3 marks)*

*Record MS009 in* `data/messy.csv` has the year `c.1590` — circa, approximately. Manuscript dating is often approximate, and a scholar may genuinely only know the decade. Your program currently rejects it, so the record is lost.

*Choose one and argue for it:*

- **(a)** Reject it. Only exact years enter the catalogue.
- **(b)** Store the year as text, so anything can be recorded.
- **(c)** Store `1590` plus a separate `approximate` flag.

**Our choice:**

**Why:**

**What it costs us:**

## 4\. Our test table *(3 marks)*

### `validate_year`

| Test data | Value | Expected | Actual | Pass? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | 1655 | valid |  |  |
| Abnormal |  |  |  |  |
| Extreme (low) | 1100 | valid |  |  |
| Extreme (high) |  |  |  |  |
| Boundary (below) | 1099 | invalid |  |  |
| Boundary (above) |  |  |  |  |

### `_______________` *(one other field of your choice)*

| Test data | Value | Expected | Actual | Pass? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 5\. Collaboration reflection *(2 marks)*

*One paragraph each, written separately and signed. Do not write these together — the point is two honest accounts.*

***(partner 1 name)*:** One thing my partner did that I will steal: One thing I would do differently next time:

***(partner 2 name)*:** One thing my partner did that I will steal: One thing I would do differently next time:

## 6\. Declaration
